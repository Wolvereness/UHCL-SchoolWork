This is a collection of works I completed for my assignments as a student. I
condemn plagiarism, and I assume no liability for how you use these works.
In this spirit that condemns plagiarism, I have elected to add supplemental
terms to these works. If these terms are of issue to your particular use, I
encourage you to come into contact with me.

You are welcome to use these works, as provided by the GNU GPL v3, with
supplemented terms. These supplemental terms are enumerated here:

1. to propagate this work, you must preserve appropriate legal notices
provided in any files, any projects, and any output, and

2. to propagate this work, you must clearly identify the original author, and

3. to propagate this work, you must clearly identify changes from the work
provided by the original author, preferably by use of standard version control
(git or similar) practices.

These supplemental terms cover no less and no more than as outlined by the
appropriate sub-sections of section 7 in the GNU GPLv3, copied here for
clarity:

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or


The following is the license header that applies to all works.
